# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO: Something close to it's game type so "Slither Away", maybe?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO: Not very creative but I thought I'll just start with something simple, a snake game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO: Work like a snake game. Eat the food and get longer in the progress. If you (the snake) touch yourself or the border, game end.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO: At least get it to move like a snake game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: The good outcome is something I think I'll definetely get it to work. Up, down, in circle, etc but getting it to eat the food and let it follow you and ending the game is not something, I see myself able to let it do.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: Get it to work like a snake game. Eat food, touch border or yourself to end game. So basically good outcome + better outcome = best outcome.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO: I'll need to learn more about the lua programming language, definitely. I been watching some videos about making a game using Love2D Lua on youtube. Hope it will help me.
