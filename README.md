Project Name: Slither Away!

Name: Cindy 

Year: Don't know or not sure. 

I decided to choose to make a game beause I hope to learn to make a RPG someday. I started with, what I thought would be easy but it's not, a snake game
called Slither Away! which is not very creative, I know. I never tried making a game before so this is my first try. It's unfinished so all you can do right
now is move the snake (pig) around by using the arrow button on the keyboard (up, down, left, right) so it's boring~ The challenge of making this game work is something 
I never overcame. I hope I can fix my snake problem and 
make it work someday so I can play it. I wanted it to work like a snake game but a little differently since
there are so many snake game such as end the game when the point reaches a certain number or do something different. I had fun learning the lua programming language which is 
different from Python. At first, all I could think about was "Do I have to learn to use the love program?" but it turned out to be fun. I do enjoy learning new things.   
I learned to do a part of my unfinished project from DevJeeper - MAKING A GAME In 3 Easy Steps Using Love2D & Lua (Part 1 through 3)
