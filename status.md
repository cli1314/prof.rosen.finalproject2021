Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

TODO: I was able to set the background color, make the snake (I just went with a pig 
      picture) appear and move, make the food (sushi) appear at random places when
      reload screen, set a border so they don't move beyond it.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

TODO: Make the pig "eat" the sushi and make a long snake. Make it feel more game like
      such as end with game over. There are alot of snake games so I wanted to try to 
      make it different such as, not sure if it's already made but, I want to try to
      end the game when the score hit a point (each apple worth maybe 10-20 points) or
      hit the border.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

TODO: Perhaps learning the lua program code. When I read the wiki, it
      seem easy to learn but still hard to apply it even with Youtube help. Perhaps give me a few years. :(
      All I learn and know now are things I did with the project currently.
